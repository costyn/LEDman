# LEDman

This is code for a LED stickman costume, using the OctoWS2811 adapter with a Teensy3.2. Perhaps a bit overkill for only 280 LEDs, but it was a fun project to learn how to use this adapter.

At the moment the left and right legs are connected to the same pin, so are mirrored. Same with left and right arms.
